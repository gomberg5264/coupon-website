	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>As new smartphone models hit the market this approaching autumn, it’s not only everyday consumers who are thinking of switching phones. The New York City Police Department says it will give up it&#8217;s 36,000 windows phones and transition to iPhones by the end of the year.</p>
<p>The switch is prompted in part by news in July that said Microsoft was ending support for Windows 8.1 Mobile, which a large percentage of all Windows-powered phones are still using. It’s a predictable end to the Windows phone, considering that its market share had already slipped below 1 percent at the time the police department adopted its phones last year. The ill-fated decision to go with the Windows phone was made solely by its NYPD deputy commissioner for IT, according to The New York Post, and apparently did not receive further judgment before implementing the program.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/2274877/Solarvista_Images/Blog_Images/iphoneandwp8_600x550.jpg" /></p>
<p>The Windows models were Nokia Lumia 830 and Lumia 640 XL, equipped with special 911 apps, case management apps, and the ability to receive assignments. They were purchased as part of a $160 million initiative to modernize the NYPD, which has been around since 1845. The new business for Microsoft’s phones was clearly not enough to keep Windows Phone alive.</p>
<p>The NYPD has not specified which model of the iPhone it plans to give to law enforcement officers, but the switch will happen after the iPhone 8 will have already been released. However, given the rumoured pricing, it seems highly unlikely that NYPD police will be carrying the latest version of the device.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Social networking giant Facebook is reportedly working towards rolling out a video chat device that can recognise users&#8217; faces.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1em;">The proposed device is said to be similar to the Amazon Echo Show, and will feature a camera, touchscreen and speakers, the Independent reported on Thursday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1em;">But the device has also raised fears among consumers that it could be used by the social network to spy on them, thereby casting doubt on whether the device would have all the features as intended when it is finally launched. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1em;">Codenamed Project Aloha, the device is set to be released by Facebook in May 2018. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1em;">However, it may hit the market under a new brand name, the report said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1em;">The device is likely to be marketed as a tool to help old people communicate with their families and friends.</span></p>
<p>Aloha represents Facebook&#8217;s first serious foray into selling consumer hardware. The company&#8217;s Oculus subsidiary started selling the high-end Rift VR headset in January 2016, but Facebook hopes that Aloha will have more mass market appeal.</p>
<p>With a large touchscreen, speakers, and camera for making video calls, the device is intended to compete directly with the 299 dollar Amazon Prime show, which was released in June.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.facebook.com/images/fb_icon_325x325.png" /></p>
<p>While details about Aloha (including the name) may change before it sees the light of day, here&#8217;s what people familiar with the device told Business Insider abruptly about the device:</p>
<ul>
<li>Work on Aloha began after Facebook executives saw the success of Amazon&#8217;s first Echo, and now the Echo Show is seen internally as Aloha&#8217;s main competitor.</li>
<li>Aloha will be the first product to come out of Building 8, Facebook&#8217;s top-secret consumer hardware lab lead by ex-Darpa and Google exec Regina Dugan. Facebook recently put longtime VP Andrew Bosworth in charge of the company&#8217;s consumer hardware, including Oculus and Building 8.</li>
<li>The device will feature a large touchscreen along with a camera and speakers and be capable of recognizing people when they step into view. 13-inch and 15-inch versions of the device are in the works.</li>
<li>The magic of Aloha lies in its camera, which one source described as an &#8220;AI cameraman.&#8221; Facebook has hired top computer vision and AI experts to make the camera automatically frame shots and recognize objects in view. The device is intended to be used in the home and has been tested in kitchens, bedrooms, and living rooms.</li>
<li>Aloha will require either a Facebook or Messenger account to work, and will hook into the owner&#8217;s list of Facebook friends. That integration would let Aloha recommend that you start a video call with another Aloha owner if both of you are present, for example. One thing that is not yet clear is how Aloha will handle situations involving multiple users in a house with individual Facebook accounts.</li>
<li>The voice assistant Aloha runs on is loosely based on M, the AI chat bot assistant Facebook developed for Messenger. Opening up an audio version of M to commerce would allow Aloha owners to make purchases with their voice, as can be done with the Amazon Echo.</li>
<li>Facebook has looked at selling Aloha for as much as $499 but hasn&#8217;t landed on a final price point.</li>
<li>Aloha will be sold in stores and online. Facebook has considered selling Aloha through pop-up stores and inside existing retail stores like Best Buy. The plan is to sell the device in North America and Europe at first.</li>
<li>One hurdle Facebook has faced in building Aloha is consumer mistrust of Facebook protecting user privacy. The company conducted marketing studies for project Aloha and received overwhelming concern that Facebook would use the device to spy on users.</li>
<li>To assuage concerns about privacy, Facebook has considered creative ways to market Aloha, including pitching it as a device for letting the elderly easily communicate with their families.</li>
</ul>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Social media sites Facebook and Instagram appear to be down for some users this morning with some unable to post and others unable to access the sites entirely.</p>
<p>Facebook users have reported issues accessing page mailboxes, uploading images, and posting updates, on both the mobile and web versions. Some users received messages saying that there was a “temporary problem with this post,” or an issue with a URL, and to try again in a few minutes. Other users were greeted with a message that Facebook is down for “required maintenance.”</p>

<p>Instagram users also found some issues when trying to access the site this morning:</p>
<p>The outage doesn’t appear to be affecting all users, and the cause for issues aren’t immediately clear. A Facebook spokesperson told <em>The Verge</em> in an email that “a technical issue,” was the cause of the issue, and that the company is “currently restoring service for everyone.”</p>

<p><img src="https://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/samsung-galaxy-note-8-specs-black-980x637.jpg" />But the Note is back because Samsung believes there are still consumers who love it. Assuming the company can avoid unforeseen disaster with the Galaxy Note 8, it will have made a triumphant return from one of its most humbling failures. <span style="color: #ff6600;">Note 8 is great flagship by Samsung</span> in 2017 but the 1000$ (approx.) price and upcoming iPhone 8 will decide its sales.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>.EA Sports released the first FIFA Street game back in 2005 with a great public response . The last version of FIFA Street , FIFA Street 4 was released in 2012.</p>
<p>The game is a spin-off of EA&#8217;s <i>FIFA series </i>of football games, following the same formula as their other &#8220;Street&#8221; titles, NFL Street and NBA Street by reducing the more complete version of the game into a simpler arcade style game. It focuses on flair, style and trickery, as opposed to what <i>FIFA Football</i>focuses on team play and tactics, reflecting the culture of freestyle football played in the streets and backlots across the world.</p>
<p>Using reputation and respect gained from playing 4-on-4 games with tricks and flair, the aim of <i>FIFA Street</i> is to build a team up of well-known and recognised players and progress through Street venues all across the world .</p>
<p>FIFA Street brought the skills of street football to the gaming world and was obviously adorned with Ronaldinho on the front cover. Nothing was more fun than embarrassing your mates with flicks and tricks and going past them over and over again.</p>
<p>It has recently emerged that FIFA Street will be making a comeback in the soon to be launched FIFA 18. This was reveled by a leaked video from EA&#8217;s Gamescon display. Below is the video showing FIFA Street in FIFA 18.</p>
<p>https://twitter.com/AlkegYT/status/899937203165569024</p>
<p>We certainly hope that this is true . What do you think of it, let us know in the comments section below and don&#8217;t forget to check our social media pages.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>India has imposed anti-dumping duty on tempered glass, used for protecting mobile phone screens, from China for five years to protect the domestic industry from below-cost imports.</p>
<p>The Revenue Department has issued a notification imposing anti-dumping duty in the range of $52.85- 136.21 per tonne on tempered glass imports from China.</p>
<p>The duty has been imposed on &#8216;textured toughened (Tempered) Glass with a minimum of 90.5 per cent transmission having thickness not exceeding 4.2 mm (including tolerance of 0.2 mm) and where at least one dimension exceeds 1500 mm, whether coated or uncoated.</p>
<p>Investigations by the Directorate General of Anti-Dumping and Allied Duties (DGAD) had found that tempered glass has been exported to India from China below its associated normal value.</p>
<p>India imposes anti-dumping duty to protect domestic industry from an increase in cheap price imports.</p>

<p>Commerce and Industry Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had earlier this month told Rajya Sabha  that, &#8220;anti-dumping duty is in force on 93 products concerning imports from China&#8221;.</p>
<p>These products belong to a broad group of chemicals and petrochemicals, products of steel and other metals, fibres and yarn, machinery items, rubber or plastic products, electric and electronic items and consumer goods, among others.</p>
<p>India&#8217;s imports from China marginally dipped to $61.28 billion in 2016-17 as against $61.7 in the previous fiscal.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Your phone has been keeping a comprehensive list of everywhere you’ve been – and you might not even know.</p>
<p>Whether you use iOS or Android, handsets have ways of watching where their owners are going and keeping a record of all of that information.</p>
<p>The data can be a very useful way of reminding yourself where you&#8217;ve been or when exactly you went on a certain trip. It also allows the phones to tell you useful information by knowing where you tend to go and on what days.</p>
<p>But it can also be a strange way of remembering just how much information some technology companies store about your life.</p>
<p>Google has perhaps the neatest way of looking at all of that information on itsYour Timeline page, which used to be known as Location History.  You can head there and see a map of everywhere you’ve been with your phone – grouped into trips and dates.</p>
<p>The site uses the data for its various location-aware tools, including Maps and notifications that can make you aware of things that are happening nearby.</p>
<p>It’s from that same page that you can opt to enable the tool if it’s not already turned on, or to pause it.</p>
<p>If you’re on Android, then the tracking feature can happen using just the phone. On iOS it needs an app – the Google app, for instance, can track your location and send it to Google while it sits in the background.</p>
<p>Google also makes it easy to turn off location information, and to delete either everything or specific parts of the information that it has stored.</p>
<p>To turn the whole thing off, you can head to your Google account and turn the “Location History” switch off. Since you’re doing that at the account level, it will change whatever device has been tracking you.</p>
<p>To delete it, you head to the location history page above and select either a day or location and opt to delete that history. Otherwise you can pick the “Delete all history” option to get rid of the entire thing.</p>
<p>Apple also does something similar, in its iPhones.</p>
<p>To see the list, you can head to the Settings app and click on Privacy. There you’ll find an option for Location services, which is also the place you can disable any other app from tracking you.</p>
<p>Scroll down to the bottom of that list and find the setting for System Services. Click on that and choose Frequent Locations.</p>
<p>In there you’ll find a list of everywhere you’ve been and how many times you’ve been there.</p>
<p>Like Google, Apple uses that information to understand more about what you do. It will be able to tell if you tend to drive home at a certain time each day, for instance, and suggest that traffic is looking bad if it is.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that none of Apple’s Frequent Locations data is sent to Apple by default, and it just lives on your phone. That can make it less useful than Google’s version – you can’t view it on the web, and you&#8217;ll lose it if you move to a new phone – but it also means that it won&#8217;t be used for advertising or anythign else.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>If you haven&#8217;t read our previous article covering the latest explosion of the Redmi Note 4 , here where you can read it:<a href="http://www.yourtechshow.com/another-xiaomi-redmi-note-4-explodes/"> http://www.yourtechshow.com/another-xiaomi-redmi-note-4-explodes/</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Xiaomi<span style="font-size: 1em;"> has released a preliminary report on the recent case of </span>Redmi<span style="font-size: 1em;"> Note 4 explosion in East Godavari, Andhra Pradesh. The company said that it was able to procure the device after a week of multiple conversations with the customer, who had claimed to be seriously injured due to the explosion.</span></p>
<p>“Upon first impressions of the damaged device, we can conclude that extreme external force was applied to the device, which led to the back cover and battery being bent and screen getting damaged. A detailed investigation has been launched to understand the exact cause of the damage,” Xiaomi said in a statement.</p>
<p>“We would like to request our customers to avoid opening the device, puncturing the battery or applying extreme physical force to the device. Further, do refrain from getting your smartphone repaired at unauthorized repair shops. Instead, if you find issues with your device, visit Xiaomi Authorized Service Centers or reach us directly on our hotline 1800 103 6286,” it further said.</p>
<p>Earlier, the owner of the smartphone, Bhavana Suryakiran claimed to have suffered serious injuries after his Redmi Note 4 unit exploded in his pocket. The owner had bought the smartphone from Flipkart three weeks ago. Bhavana had then said he was planning to take a legal action against Xiaomi and Flipkart for selling a ‘defective’ unit.</p>
<p>The latest incident comes days after a video showing an alleged Redmi Note 4 exploding, went viral. The video, however, was later turned to be a fake one.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1em;">Xiaomi has launched an investigation after a Redmi Note 4 smartphone exploded in the pocket of a user in Ravulapalem in Andhra Pradesh’s East Godavari district. The owner of the smartphone, Bhavana Suryakiran reportedly suffered serious injuries due to the explosion. The smartphone company said it has contacted Suryakiran and is investigating the matter.</span></p>
<p>“We take such matters seriously as customer safety is of utmost importance for Xiaomi. All of our devices go through stringent quality tests,” a Xiaomi spokesperson said in a statement, adding that they have contacted the customer and are in the process of procuring the damaged product to investigate the matter.</p>
<p><a href="http://english.sakshi.com/news/2017/08/13/redmi-note-4-explodes-in-owners-pocket-leaves-a-hole-in-his-thigh">Sakshi.com</a>, a Telugu news website, reported that the explosion took place when Suryakiran was riding a bike. A fire that broke out after the explosion could not be doused despite pouring water on his pants.</p>
<p>Suryakiran reportedly bought the smartphone from Flipkart 20 days ago. He added that he will move the court against Xiaomi for selling a ‘defective’ unit and seeking compensation for injuries sustained.</p>
<p>The incident comes weeks after a video showing an alleged Redmi Note 4 exploding, went viral. The video, however, later turned out to be a fake.</p>
<p>The company said after investigation, it found that a Redmi Note 4 belonging to Bangalore-based Arjun had exploded and the damage was caused due to a faulty third-party charger used by the customer.</p>
<p>“In addition, there were signs of physical damage on the phone as well. We advise our customers to only use Xiaomi authorised chargers and accessories,” the company had said.</p>
<p>Mobile phones exploding or catching fire is certainly not new. YouTube has a number of such videos. Just last year, Samsung faced a major crisis when it had to recall millions of<a href="http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dgca-bans-samsung-s-galaxy-note-7-phones-on-planes-over-fire-risk/story-RlVm6zZDNVC8Xk5o149htK.html">Galaxy Note 7</a> units after multiple reports of the smartphone catching fire.</p>
<p>Several airlines and airport authorities banned the use of the phone while travelling. According to Samsung’s probe, the Note 7 fires and explosions were caused due to faulty batteries.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><span style="font-family: ABeeZee;">      Hello Everyone!! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: ABeeZee;">      This is Omay from TTSMG and we are here with some new app reviews!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: ABeeZee;">It has been quite some time since our last post.. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: ABeeZee;">so, without further ado, here are some reviews 😀</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-family: ABeeZee;">Orphic:</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1162" src="http://www.yourtechshow.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screenshot_20170812-002744-576x1024.png" alt="" width="366" height="650" /></p>
<p><span style="font-family: ABeeZee;">      </span><span style="font-family: ABeeZee;">This app shows you uncommon words and their meaning. It has its own widget, so that you can access the app without opening it. You may set the refresh rate of the widget from 30 minutes upto 24 hours. If you access the app, it shows you a plethora of words and their meaning. Pretty much improving one&#8217;s vocabulary. The widget appearance can be varied as per preference and the size adapts to the definition length. The widget screenshot is as shown below.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1163" src="http://www.yourtechshow.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screenshot_20170811-233455-576x1024.png" alt="" width="366" height="650" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-family: ABeeZee;">Video Compress:</span></span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1164" src="http://www.yourtechshow.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screenshot_20170812-000826-576x1024.png" alt="" width="366" height="650" /></p>
<p><span style="font-family: ABeeZee;">      This is a handy app when there is an urgent need of video compression and editing. Although not as powerful  as its counterpart software which are computer based, this app uses your smartphone&#8217;s processor in order to carry out compression, video cutting, extracting mp3 track from video and so on. It gets the job done with a little heat and time depending on how large the compression ratio is and how efficient your SoC is. </span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1165" src="http://www.yourtechshow.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screenshot_20170812-000814-1080x1300.png" alt="" width="366" height="650" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-family: ABeeZee;">Flippy Knife:</span></span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1168" src="http://www.yourtechshow.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screenshot_20170812-001552-576x1024.png" alt="" width="366" height="650" /></p>
<p><span style="font-family: ABeeZee;">       A game for those who have less time to indulge in a story or learn rules, also for those who love minimalist themed games. It has a beautiful art style, and really simple interface. You have to move a knife to achieve goals like flipping it onto a log blade side down, hitting a target, traversing through platforms and there is also a game mode inspired by nin-jump. With a large selection of knives, and a simplistic gameplay, you won&#8217;t be bored for your next long-haul trip.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1169" src="http://www.yourtechshow.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screenshot_20170806-223527-1080x1300.png" alt="" width="366" height="650" /></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1170" src="http://www.yourtechshow.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screenshot_20170806-223515-1080x1300.png" alt="" width="366" height="650" /></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1172" src="http://www.yourtechshow.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screenshot_20170812-003904-1080x1300.png" alt="" width="366" height="650" /></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1172" src="http://www.yourtechshow.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screenshot_20170812-003904-1080x1300.png" alt="" width="366" height="650" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-family: ABeeZee;">DUAL:</span></span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1166 size-large" src="http://www.yourtechshow.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screenshot_20170812-000739-1024x576.png" alt="" width="688" height="387" /></p>
<p><span style="font-family: ABeeZee;">      An awesome take on offline multiplayer. The User interface is just innovative. It has three game modes, of which only one is available for free, which is the multi-player duel mode. In this mode, you face your opponent, in a one-on-one drone battle. The other two modes are available in the paid version, which are co-op defense of a line from invading ships and the last mode consists of deflecting a striker into the opponent&#8217;s goal (yeah just like Air hockey). Unlike most other offline co-op games, this app, utilizes both the screens of the involved parties, such that there is a larger display available for the game. By aligning both the smartphones the game may begin. It utilizes either a Wi-Fi connection(Devices on the same network) or even Bluetooth.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1167 size-large" src="http://www.yourtechshow.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screenshot_20170812-000733-1024x576.png" alt="" width="688" height="387" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: ABeeZee;">Tutorial for Duel mode </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: ABeeZee;">      So everyone, that was it for this post..Hope you have found this helpful 😀</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: ABeeZee;"> See you soon!</span></p>
