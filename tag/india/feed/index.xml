				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>India has imposed anti-dumping duty on tempered glass, used for protecting mobile phone screens, from China for five years to protect the domestic industry from below-cost imports.</p>
<p>The Revenue Department has issued a notification imposing anti-dumping duty in the range of $52.85- 136.21 per tonne on tempered glass imports from China.</p>
<p>The duty has been imposed on &#8216;textured toughened (Tempered) Glass with a minimum of 90.5 per cent transmission having thickness not exceeding 4.2 mm (including tolerance of 0.2 mm) and where at least one dimension exceeds 1500 mm, whether coated or uncoated.</p>
<p>Investigations by the Directorate General of Anti-Dumping and Allied Duties (DGAD) had found that tempered glass has been exported to India from China below its associated normal value.</p>
<p>India imposes anti-dumping duty to protect domestic industry from an increase in cheap price imports.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Commerce and Industry Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had earlier this month told Rajya Sabha  that, &#8220;anti-dumping duty is in force on 93 products concerning imports from China&#8221;.</p>
<p>These products belong to a broad group of chemicals and petrochemicals, products of steel and other metals, fibres and yarn, machinery items, rubber or plastic products, electric and electronic items and consumer goods, among others.</p>
<p>India&#8217;s imports from China marginally dipped to $61.28 billion in 2016-17 as against $61.7 in the previous fiscal.</p>
