<p>According to Macquarie Capital Securities analyst Damian Thong Sony could release their next gen console in the second half of 2018.</p>
<p>It has been observed that Damian Thong has been spot on with his previous predictions of Sony&#8217;s console releases. He predicted the release of the Sony Playstation 4 Pro and Slim.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what he said</p>
<blockquote><p>Even without any insider knowledge, I can say with certainty that Sony <em>is </em>working on a new console, because these things take years to develop. But will we see it on shelves in 2018? I seriously doubt it. While announcing a new console could potentially be a way for Sony to disrupt the momentum Microsoft is building with Project Scorpio, the PlayStation 4 Pro is barely six months old right now and its official announcement isn’t even a year old. While consoles are moving toward a mobile phone-like model for updating and compatibility, fans would balk at a new console so soon.</p></blockquote>
