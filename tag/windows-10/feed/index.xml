<p><span style="font-size: 1em;">This is the 4th update of Windows 10 and will bring many new features to this system. All of them have already been tested in the Insider program, through which beta testers and developers reported all the errors and problems.</span></p>
<p>This new version will finally bring to Windows 10 the Microsoft VR platform, Windows Mixed Reality, which can be used by cheaper glasses and helmets, such as those that Lenovo has now presented at the IFA.</p>
