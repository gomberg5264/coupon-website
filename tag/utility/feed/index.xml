				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-family: ABeeZee;">Â  Â Â  Â Hello Everyone!! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: ABeeZee;">Â  Â Â  Â This is Omay from TTSMG and we are here with some new app reviews!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: ABeeZee;">It has been quite some time since our last post.. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: ABeeZee;">so, without further ado, here are some reviews <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f600.png" alt="ðŸ˜€" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-family: ABeeZee;">Orphic:</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1162" src="http://www.yourtechshow.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screenshot_20170812-002744-576x1024.png" alt="" width="366" height="650" /></p>
<p><span style="font-family: ABeeZee;">Â  Â Â  Â </span><span style="font-family: ABeeZee;">This app shows you uncommon words and their meaning. It has its own widget, so that you can access the app without opening it. You may set the refresh rate of the widget from 30 minutes upto 24 hours. If you access the app, it shows you a plethora of words and their meaning. Pretty much improving one&#8217;s vocabulary. The widget appearance can be varied as per preference and the size adapts to the definition length. The widget screenshot is as shown below.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1163" src="http://www.yourtechshow.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screenshot_20170811-233455-576x1024.png" alt="" width="366" height="650" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-family: ABeeZee;">Video Compress:</span></span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1164" src="http://www.yourtechshow.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screenshot_20170812-000826-576x1024.png" alt="" width="366" height="650" /></p>
<p><span style="font-family: ABeeZee;">Â  Â Â  Â This is a handy app when there is an urgent need of video compression and editing. Although not as powerful Â as its counterpart software which are computer based, this app uses your smartphone&#8217;s processor in order to carry out compression, video cutting, extracting mp3 track from video and so on. It gets the job done with a little heat and time depending on how large the compression ratio is and how efficient your SoC is.Â </span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1165" src="http://www.yourtechshow.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screenshot_20170812-000814-1080x1300.png" alt="" width="366" height="650" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-family: ABeeZee;">Flippy Knife:</span></span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1168" src="http://www.yourtechshow.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screenshot_20170812-001552-576x1024.png" alt="" width="366" height="650" /></p>
<p><span style="font-family: ABeeZee;"> Â  Â Â  Â A game for those who have less time to indulge in a story or learn rules, also for those who love minimalist themed games. It has a beautiful art style, and really simple interface. You have to move a knife to achieve goals like flipping it onto a log blade side down, hitting a target, traversing through platforms and there is also a game mode inspired by nin-jump. With a large selection of knives, and a simplistic gameplay, you won&#8217;t be bored for your next long-haul trip.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1169" src="http://www.yourtechshow.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screenshot_20170806-223527-1080x1300.png" alt="" width="366" height="650" /></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1170" src="http://www.yourtechshow.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screenshot_20170806-223515-1080x1300.png" alt="" width="366" height="650" /></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1172" src="http://www.yourtechshow.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screenshot_20170812-003904-1080x1300.png" alt="" width="366" height="650" /></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1172" src="http://www.yourtechshow.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screenshot_20170812-003904-1080x1300.png" alt="" width="366" height="650" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-family: ABeeZee;">DUAL:</span></span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1166 size-large" src="http://www.yourtechshow.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screenshot_20170812-000739-1024x576.png" alt="" width="688" height="387" /></p>
<p><span style="font-family: ABeeZee;">Â  Â Â  Â An awesome take on offline multiplayer. The User interface is just innovative. It has three game modes, of which only one is available for free, which is the multi-player duel mode. In this mode, you face your opponent, in a one-on-one drone battle. The other two modes are available in the paid version, which are co-op defense of a line from invading ships and the last mode consists of deflecting a striker into the opponent&#8217;s goal (yeah just like Air hockey). Unlike most other offline co-op games, this app, utilizes both the screens of the involved parties, such that there is a larger display available for the game. By aligning both the smartphones the game may begin. It utilizes either a Wi-Fi connection(Devices on the same network) or even Bluetooth.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1167 size-large" src="http://www.yourtechshow.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screenshot_20170812-000733-1024x576.png" alt="" width="688" height="387" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: ABeeZee;">Tutorial for Duel modeÂ </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: ABeeZee;">Â  Â  Â  So everyone, that was it for this post..Hope you have found this helpful <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f600.png" alt="ðŸ˜€" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: ABeeZee;"> See you soon!</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-family: ABeeZee; font-size: 16px;">Here are some apps, that I use a lot and find really handy in day to day proceedings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: ABeeZee; font-size: 16px;">Sectograph:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: ABeeZee; font-size: 16px;">Ever feel bored scrolling through your schedule and have trouble keeping the clock in sync with your activities. Well here you go.. this is sectograph it is a personal clock come schedule display. It syncs with a calendar app and even with your Gmail account. So you don&#8217;t have to worry about updating your schedule two times. Displaying both time and the upcoming activity is really handy.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: ABeeZee; font-size: 16px;"><img class="aligncenter" title="" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/nTL5NnP97mPkE4aGHJ7klBO7ZjKptOBl3cVjZdtfF2XlbZkNHzYNiZe5ObsgOxr2CK2fOweQ8iiZ7Q=s600" alt="" width="253" height="450" /></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: ABeeZee; font-size: 16px;">Night Owl:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: ABeeZee; font-size: 16px;">If you are a night owl, this app is for you. Studies have shown that blue light tricks the brain into staying awake which may cause Insomnia i.e. not be able to sleep at night. This app locks out the blue light allowing you to use your phone without interfering with your sleep pattern. It can also be configured to filter other colours, but the default is blue. Unfortunately this app cannot have allow you to sleep 7 hours of sleep in 4 hours.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: ABeeZee; font-size: 16px;"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/mZ01k3c2cR1w6FmVg9VCxfVIczmzz6zPcbv4DqgElCF1N0OnfhktCnes6PF2GlrppNT-iCp1FqUhBg=s600" width="256" height="512" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: ABeeZee; font-size: 16px;">Daylio:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: ABeeZee; font-size: 16px;">Ever feel the need to keep track of day to day stuff, but can not write much about it or are just lazy like me xD&#8230;well Daylio is for you. This is not just another Diary app. This allows you to mark your mood for each time of the day and what activities you were doing. Activities are represented by Icons. They can be edited if,the need arises. Also the app is password protected by a 4 digit pin and can be backed up to Google drive. The best part is your mood can be reviewed as per week, month or Year. Now, a diary entry is just a few taps away!</span><br />
<span style="font-family: ABeeZee; font-size: 16px;"> <img class="aligncenter" title="" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/IkrG1wUo81riDXEUKERbp746MfAhBOS-dUMQL504BziKJu4nUcVM976r8MdxzuszlsJH1afoGIgorQ=s600" alt="" width="338" height="600" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: ABeeZee; font-size: 16px;">Google Keep:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: ABeeZee; font-size: 16px;">If I were to say that Google Keep is just another notes app, I would be so wrong. Well actually, no, it&#8217;s just a really convenient one at that. Its convenience stems from it being a Google app, so it can be synced from different devices in real time (almost.. I had to refresh it in order to sync).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: ABeeZee; font-size: 16px;">The notes can be archived, labelled and even colored in order to differentiate them better. You can also store pictures and sound recordings on the app and even drawings (i.e. the pen icon). The smaller widget lacks the feature of displaying the notes, but is really efficient in terms of space. However, the larger widget is better for usage but it takes up a lot of space in order for the user to be able to even read the notes effectively.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: ABeeZee; font-size: 16px;">P.S&gt;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: ABeeZee; font-size: 16px;">F.Y.I. This review was written with the help of this very app :P.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: ABeeZee; font-size: 16px;">Mobile view:</span><br />
<span style="font-family: ABeeZee; font-size: 16px;"> <img class="aligncenter" title="" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/_qJ2WLdtuelXf4qtVrXl3ZKYvJxfBhlahZdydGbUX9gPgNTQslnB8eewajMb407cV-jAw7cAbeGmrQ=s600" alt="" width="231" height="410" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: ABeeZee; font-size: 16px;">Widgets:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: ABeeZee; font-size: 16px;"><img class="aligncenter" title="" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/8XgSxo9dDC7PAYazxMCSYryl1Ue6l2V0ErdarkSCudRSgqYFutdQH-gDxXN34OkeKagyV70S9LeZQQ=s600" alt="" width="251" height="446" /></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: ABeeZee; font-size: 16px;">That was all! Hope you find this review helpful <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f600.png" alt="ðŸ˜€" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></span></p>
