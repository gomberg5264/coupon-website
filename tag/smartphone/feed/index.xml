				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>India has imposed anti-dumping duty on tempered glass, used for protecting mobile phone screens, from China for five years to protect the domestic industry from below-cost imports.</p>
<p>The Revenue Department has issued a notification imposing anti-dumping duty in the range of $52.85- 136.21 per tonne on tempered glass imports from China.</p>
<p>The duty has been imposed on &#8216;textured toughened (Tempered) Glass with a minimum of 90.5 per cent transmission having thickness not exceeding 4.2 mm (including tolerance of 0.2 mm) and where at least one dimension exceeds 1500 mm, whether coated or uncoated.</p>
<p>Investigations by the Directorate General of Anti-Dumping and Allied Duties (DGAD) had found that tempered glass has been exported to India from China below its associated normal value.</p>
<p>India imposes anti-dumping duty to protect domestic industry from an increase in cheap price imports.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1199" src="http://www.yourtechshow.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/tempered-screen-protector-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Commerce and Industry Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had earlier this month told Rajya Sabha  that, &#8220;anti-dumping duty is in force on 93 products concerning imports from China&#8221;.</p>
<p>These products belong to a broad group of chemicals and petrochemicals, products of steel and other metals, fibres and yarn, machinery items, rubber or plastic products, electric and electronic items and consumer goods, among others.</p>
<p>India&#8217;s imports from China marginally dipped to $61.28 billion in 2016-17 as against $61.7 in the previous fiscal.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Razer is interested in building a smartphone for gamers, according to a report from Bloomberg. The company is planning an IPO in Hong Kong later this year that could value its business at $5 billion. It will reportedly use some of the funds to build its smartphone.</p>
<p id="SmJzFI">The news isn’t that surprising, given that Razer acquired the smartphone company Nextbit earlier this year. Razer said Nextbit would operate as an independent company at the time of the acquisition, but hasn’t said much publicly about it since.</p>
<p id="xPioH2">There are a lot of questions left to be answered, including whether the gaming-centric smartphone will come out under the Nextbit or Razer brand, and whether the company can even sell enough of them to make it worthwhile. Razer isn’t planning to IPO until around October, so we likely won’t see this device until 2018 at the earliest.</p>
<p>What do you think would be the phones cost and do you think it&#8217;s a good move from the gaming giants? Discuss in the comments section below .</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you&#8217;ve seen videos on Facebook and other social media sites of a hologram pyramid and wondered how it&#8217;s done then you&#8217;re at the right place. Here&#8217;s how you make your own hologram pyramid.</p>
<h3>Required Materials</h3>
<ol>
<li>0.5mm thick transparent acrylic/plastic sheet. (You can use plastic sheets used in packaging)</li>
<li>Access to printer (if possible)</li>
<li>Scissors</li>
<li>Cutting Knives</li>
<li>Clear cellotape</li>
<li>Ruler</li>
<li>Pen</li>
<li>Smartphone</li>
</ol>
<h3>Follow These Steps for Your Own DIY Hologram Pyramid</h3>
<p>1. Print out the template shown below on a sheet of A4 size paper.<a href="https://301o583r8shhildde3s0vcnh-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/holoTemp-min.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-7908 aligncenter" src="https://301o583r8shhildde3s0vcnh-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/holoTemp-min.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 412px) 100vw, 412px" srcset="https://301o583r8shhildde3s0vcnh-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/holoTemp-min.jpg 412w, https://301o583r8shhildde3s0vcnh-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/holoTemp-min-300x278.jpg 300w" alt="diy hologram" width="412" height="382" data-cfsrc="https://301o583r8shhildde3s0vcnh-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/holoTemp-min.jpg" /></a></p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> If you do not have access to a printer, you can also make a template on your own. Draw a basic “Trapezoid” on a piece of paper using these dimensions. Parallel sides= 1cm, 6cm &amp; other two sides= 4.5cm each. You can always double or triple the dimensions in proportion to use on a larger display.</p>
<p>2. Trace out the shape on the plastic sheet using a ruler and pen. For the trapezoid template, trace out four similar outlines on the plastic sheet. Now carefully cut out the outlines with a cutting blade and ruler. Try to make your cuts as precise as possible for a perfect pyramid.</p>
<p>3. <strong>If you used the printout template:</strong>Score the red edges very lightly using a cutting blade. This will allow you to fold the edges better and form a pyramid shape. Stick the open edges of the sheet together using clear cellotape.</p>
<p><strong>If you used the trapezoid template:</strong> Join the four edges to form a pyramid shape. Stick them together.</p>
<p>Either way, in the end you will have a pyramid like the one shown below.</p>
<p><a href="https://301o583r8shhildde3s0vcnh-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/plas-min.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-7883 size-full" src="https://301o583r8shhildde3s0vcnh-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/plas-min.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" srcset="https://301o583r8shhildde3s0vcnh-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/plas-min.jpg 400w, https://301o583r8shhildde3s0vcnh-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/plas-min-300x251.jpg 300w" alt="diy hologram " width="400" height="334" data-cfsrc="https://301o583r8shhildde3s0vcnh-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/plas-min.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>4. That’s it! You have made yourself a hologram pyramid! All you have to do now is play a hologram video in your phone. Place the hologram pyramid in the middle of your screen like shown in the image below and enjoy the show. Don’t forget to switch off the lights in the room before you start playing the video.</p>
<p><a href="https://301o583r8shhildde3s0vcnh-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Hologram-Pyramid-min.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-7873 size-full" src="https://301o583r8shhildde3s0vcnh-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Hologram-Pyramid-min.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" srcset="https://301o583r8shhildde3s0vcnh-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Hologram-Pyramid-min.jpg 450w, https://301o583r8shhildde3s0vcnh-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Hologram-Pyramid-min-300x200.jpg 300w" alt="diy hologram " width="450" height="300" data-cfsrc="https://301o583r8shhildde3s0vcnh-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Hologram-Pyramid-min.jpg" /></a></p>
